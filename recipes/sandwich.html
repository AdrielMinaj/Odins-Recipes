    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Kosher salt</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Freshly ground black pepper</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/4 c. (30 g.) all-purpose flour</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/2 c. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</strong></li>
        <li><strong>6 tbsp. cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/2 c. dry white wine</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/2 c. low-sodium chicken broth</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Juice of 1 lemon</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1 (3.5-oz.) jar capers, rinsed Lemon wedges, for serving</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut chicken breasts in half parallel to work surface all the way through. In between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, pound each breast until 1/4" thick; generously season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large shallow bowl, place flour. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off excess. In a large skillet over high heat, heat 1/4 cup oil until very hot. Working with 3 chicken pieces at a time, cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Adjust heat as needed and repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In same skillet over high heat, bring wine, broth, and lemon juice to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and reduced by about one-quarter, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add butter, one piece at a time, vigorously whisking after each addition; dont stop whisking until all butter is incorporated. If sauce starts to break, add 1 tablespoon water and continue to whisk until sauce is smooth and glossy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Return chicken to skillet. Add capers, bring sauce to a light simmer, and cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges alongside.
